# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, based on the Titanic passenger dataset.

The goal is to classify whether a passenger survived or not using features like age, gender, fare, class, and more. This project focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, and building a robust classification model with clear insights.

<br/>

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Predicts survival outcomes using **Logistic Regression**, a fundamental ML classification algorithm.
- Applied extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand and prepare the data.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data for optimal performance.

<br/>

## ✅ Features

- Handled missing values using statistical techniques (mean/mode).
- Removed irrelevant features like `PassengerId`, `Ticket`, and `Cabin`.
- Converted categorical data (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) into numerical values using label encoding.
- Managed outliers to retain consistent data distribution.
- Evaluated model performance using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, and **Recall**.

<br/>

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Gained foundational understanding of **Logistic Regression** and how it works under the hood.
- Learned the significance of the **Sigmoid function** in converting linear output to probabilities.
- Built intuition around classification tasks and how to prepare data for such models.
- Created a user-interactive Python app to test the model with new inputs.

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 82%
- **Precision**: 75%
- **Recall**: 73%
